Some VBA macros I wrote for use in Word

Includes:
- A syntax highlighter for Verilog code, with the caveat that the code be selected (highlighted) first
- A toolset for convenient bookmark creation and linkage. This allows you to highlight text and hit a hotkey, and 
either create a bookmark from the selected text (at that position and with that name) or link to a bookmark with 
an identical name (case insensitive)
