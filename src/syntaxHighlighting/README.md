# Syntax Highlighting in Word

Current Features: 
- Verilog

This script takes a couple seconds to execute due to the constraints of VBA in declaring related sets of information (i.e. arrays).


I make no claims that these are the most efficient or effective methods of implementing these features, nor that they are necesarily performant
within any particular bounds or are completely accurate in highlighting. To the best of my ability however, any performance defects are minimized
and any errors in highlighting are miniscule or rare cases.
